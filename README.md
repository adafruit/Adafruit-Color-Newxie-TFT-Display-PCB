### Description

Say hello to our new Newxie 1.14" 240x135 Color TFT Display Boards â€“ we think it's T-F-Terrific! It's the size of your thumbnail, with glorious 240x135 high res pixel color. This very very small display is only 1.14" diagonal, packed with RGB pixels, for making very small high-density displays. And this breakout board is designed for compact 'stacking' on a 0.1" grid - with a vertical arrangement that mimics old-school nixie tubes. 

The display uses plain SPI (Clock, Data In, Chip Select, Data/Command) to communicate and has its own pixel-addressable frame buffer, it can be used with every kind of microcontroller. Even a very small one with low memory and few pins available! The 1.14" display has 240x135 16-bit full color pixels and is an IPS display, so the color looks great up to 80 degrees off axis in any direction. The TFT driver (ST7789) is very similar to the popular ST7735, and our Arduino library supports it well.

It's essentially the same display & breakout as our 1.14" TFT breakout but minimized: we don't include a MicroSD card or reset line. That means we have only 7 pins required to control the display and backlight. Since the display itself is 0.8" wide, it makes for a perfect fit. We pre-soldered on 2x7 right-angle headers to make it easy to design a stand-up display, both rows are the same contact - we just use dual row for better mechanical stability and so its easier to get them nice and straight. 

Our breakout has the TFT display pre-attached, as well as a ultra-low-dropout 3.3V regulator and a 3/5V level shifter so you can use it with 3.3V or 5V power and logic such as Arduino compatible, ESP32, RP2040 or Raspberry Pi computer.

Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a "good luck!" - we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, text and bitmaps as well as example code and a wiring tutorial, we also have CircuitPython/Python support for the 1.14" TFT with ST7789.
